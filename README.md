<h1 align="center">Deploy Banking App<h1> 
  
# Purpose
In previous deployments, I deployed the application on the same instance that ran the Jenkins server. After researching, I found that using the Jenkins manager/ agent architecture is perfect for scalability, distributing resources, and building applications simultaneously. Currently, I am deploying 1 version of the banking application, but implementing the Jenkins manager/ agent setup will allow me to scale if needed.
