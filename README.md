# Purpose
The purpose of this deployment is to deploy an application using Terraform to quickly spin up the infrastructure and Jenkins to create a ci/cd pipeline. In previous deployments, the application was hosted on the same instance as the Jenkins server. However, in this current deployment, the application is being deployed on a dedicated instance via an SSH connection. This separation of the Jenkins server and the application instance enhances security, facilitates scalability, and simplifies future troubleshooting efforts
